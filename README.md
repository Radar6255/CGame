# CGame

New goal is just to make a 3D renderer and model loader in C.

Just making the engine now. This only works on linux due to it using POSIX threads. I don't have a good plan on what I'm doing with this so support is going to be linux in the forseable future.

# Dependencies
This currently depends on OpenGL 4.6, cglm(https://github.com/recp/cglm), GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/), and GLFW(https://www.glfw.org/).
