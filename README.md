# CGame
A game engine I'm making in C. What is going to be? Your guess is as good as mine.

Just making the engine now. This only works on linux due to it using X11 and POSIX threads/regex. I don't have a good plan on what I'm doing with this so support is going to be linux in the forseable future. This should be supported through Windows wslg, but I currently can't test this.

# Dependencies
This currently depends on OpenGL 4.6, cglm(https://github.com/recp/cglm), GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/), and an X11 environment.
